PROJECT 2 README FILE

Due Date: Friday, March 4th, 2011
Submission Date: Monday, March 7th, 2011
Grace Period Used This Project: Prof. Govindaraju authorized a deadline of
                                March 7th since I was working alone 
										  (& working hard).

PURPOSE:

  - Write multithreaded code to find:
		1. a given amount of random numbers (specified in command line);
		2. which of those numbers are prime. 
  - Two groups of threads run concurrently storing and reading
    from a shared data structure: 
		1. those producing random numbers;
		2. those consuming random numbers and storing to a result data structure. 
  - Implement "debug level" logic to print debugging information based on a 
    user-provided debug level.

PERCENT COMPLETE:

  I believe I have completed 100% of this project.

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:

  n/a

BUGS:

  EmptyStackException frequently encountered at the singleton data structure 
  shared among the producer/consumer threads. 

FILES:

  Included with this project are 6 files:


src/threadPools/driver/Driver.java 
--> the driver of the program, where main() is. 


src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/DataInAndOut.java
--> a singleton, synchronized to handle storing and reading
--> the random numbers generated.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/GeneratorPool.java
--> pool of random number generator threads. (In reality, this 
--> class could run any runnable, not only Generator runnables.)

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/MasterGenerator.java
--> to divide work, and loop to create runnables
--> to be run in the generator pool.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/MasterWorker.java
--> to divide work, and loop to create runnables
--> to identify prime numbers.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/MillerRabin32.java
--> the algorithm that identifies prime numbers.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/RandProducer.java
--> an interface to implement the MasterGenerator.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/RandomMaker.java
--> a wrapper for the Random class (returns random integers).

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/RandomRunner.java
--> the runnable that handles making random integers.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/Results.java
--> a singleton, synchronized to handle storing primes.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/ShellThread.java
--> The thread with a "real" runnable, that is constantly
--> running.  This class handles running other runnables
--> that may be produced elsewhere. 

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/ThreadObjectPool.java
--> an interface to implement the object pools of threads.

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/WorkerPool.java
--> the thread pool that handles evaluating whether 
--> a number is prime. (In reality, this class could
--> run any runnable, not only Worker runnables.)

src/threadPools/threadPoolLibrary/WorkerRunner.java
--> the runnable that handles evaluating whether a
--> number is prime.

src/threadPools/util/Debug.java 
--> where the debug level given by the user is stored.

build.xml 
--> the ant file that controls compiling, creating jar files, 
--> & running the code.

README
--> the text file you are presently reading

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

bingsuns2% ant run

     [java] Of the numbers generated, these were prime:

TO COMPILE: see TO RUN:
TO RUN:

  You can compile and run the code with the following commands in the directory 
  threadsStarter.  Note that the file build.xml controls the processing of
  compiling, creating jarfiles, and running the code. 

  ant compile

  ant jar

  ant run

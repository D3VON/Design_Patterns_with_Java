Grace Period Used This Project: Prof. Govindaraju authorized a deadline of

										  (& working hard).

PURPOSE:

  - Write multithreaded code to find:
		1. a given amount of random numbers (specified in command line);
		2. which of those numbers are prime. 
  - Two groups of threads run concurrently storing and reading
    from a shared data structure: 
		1. those producing random numbers;
		2. those consuming random numbers and storing to a result data structure. 
  - Implement "debug level" logic to print debugging information based on a 
    user-provided debug level.

PERCENT COMPLETE:

  I believe I have completed 100% of this project.

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:

  n/a

BUGS:

  EmptyStackException frequently encountered at the singleton data structure 
  shared among the producer/consumer threads. 

FILES:

  Included with this project are 6 files:

  src/toyThreads/driver/Driver.java --the driver of the program, 
												  where main() is. 
  src/toyThreads/primeFactors/Factorizer.java --handles finding factors.
  src/toyThreads/primeFactors/Results.java --stores results for later use.
  src/toyThreads/util/Debug.java --where the debug level given by the user 
                                   (ant) is stored.
  build.xml, --the ant file that controls compiling, creating jar files, 
               & running the code.
  README, --the text file you are presently reading

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

  % ant run
  Buildfile: build.xml

  jar:

  run:
       [java] Debug value is 6
       [java] Arguments are: 120 3 6
       [java] 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 15 20 24 30 40 60 
       [java]  Good Bye 


  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
  Total time: 2 seconds



TO COMPILE: see TO RUN:
TO RUN:

  You can compile and run the code with the following commands in the directory 
  threadsStarter.  Note that the file build.xml controls the processing of
  compiling, creating jarfiles, and running the code. 

  ant compile

  ant jar

  ant run

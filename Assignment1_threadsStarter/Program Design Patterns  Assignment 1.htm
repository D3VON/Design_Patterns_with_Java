<h1> Assignment 1  </h1>


<h2> Due date </h2>
<ul> 
<li> Due by 11.59 AM EST on Monday, Feb 15th. 
</li></ul>

<br> 

Submit your code as per the provided instructions. A signup sheet will
be provided to you during class to setup an appointment with the TA to
provide a demo of your project. 



<h3> Updates </h3>

<ul>
</ul>

<h3> Assignment Goal </h3>

Through this assignment you will learn to use threads and apply good
design principles.


<h3> Team Work </h3>
Team work is NOT allowed. You have to work alone on this project. You
CANNOT collaborate or discuss the design, implementation, or debugging
ideas with any other students.

<h3> Programming Language </h3>
You are required to program using Java.

<h3> Compilation Method </h3> 

<ul>

<li> Your code should compile and run on <i> bingsuns </i> or the <i>
debian-pods </i> in the Computer Science lab in the Engineering
Building via ANT.

</li></ul> 


<h3> Policy on sharing of code </h3>

<li> EVERY line of code that you submit in this assignment should be
written by you or be part of the code template provided for this
assignment. Do NOT show your code to any other group. Our
code-comparison software can very easily detect similarities.

</li><li> Post to the listserv if you have any questions about the
requirements. Do NOT post your code to the listserv asking for help
with debugging. 


<h2>  Project Description  </h2>

<h3> Generating factors of a large number using threads </h3>

<ul>

<li> You are required to write multithreaded code to find all factors for a given positive integer.

</li><li> Accept the following as command line arguments. Note that the
command line arguments are specified in the build.xml file as
properties of the "java" command for the target "run".

<ul>
<li> the integer for which factors need to be found
</li><li> the number of threads that should to used for this application
</li><li> Debug level
</li></ul>

</li><li> Use Debug in the following way:
<ul>
<li> If Debug value is 9 or greater: print evey debug statement

</li><li> If Debug value is 7 or greater: print entry into constructors, and entry/exit from the thread's run method

</li><li> If Debug is 5 or greater, check the FIXMEs in the code template for what needs to be printed.

</li></ul>

</li><li> Write code to take care of all the FIXMEs in the provided code template.

</li><li> The grading instructions explain the points distribution for this assignment.

</li></ul>


 

<h2>  Code Organization </h2>

<ul>
<li> Your directory and file structure should NOT be different than what has been provided in the code template.
</li></ul>


<h2>  Code Templates </h2>
<ul> 
<li> Use the following <a href="http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~mgovinda/courses/cs342/assignments/assign1/threadsStarter.tar.gz">code template</a>.
</li><li> You can untar using the following commands on bingsuns (or any *nix machine)
     <ul> 
     <li> gunzip  threadStarter.tar.gz
     </li><li> tar -xvf threadStarter.tar
     </li></ul>

</li><li> You can comple and run the code with the following commands in
the directory threadsStarter. Note that the file build.xml controls
the processing of compiling, creating jar files, and running the code.

<ul>
<li> ant compile
</li><li> ant jar
</li><li> ant run
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2>  Submission </h2>

<ul>

<li> Read <a href="http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~mgovinda/courses/cs342/assignments/README.txt"> this</a> file for general
guidelines on how to prepare a README for your submission.

</li><li> Run "ant clean" and make sure all class files, object files (.o
files), executables, and backup files are deleted before creating a
zip or tarball. To create a tarball, you need to "tar" and then "gzip"
your top level directory. Create a tarball of the directory
lastName_firstName_assign1. We should be able to compile and execute
your code using the makefile and instructions you provide in the
README.txt file.

</li><li> Instructions to create a tarball
<ul>
<li> Make sure you are one level above the directory firstName_LastName_assign1.
</li><li> tar -cvf firstName_LastName_assign1.tar firstName_LastName_assign1/
</li><li> gzip firstName_LastName_assign1.tar
</li></ul>


</li><li> <b> BONUS </b>: A better way to create a tarzip file for submission is to make it
an ANT target. You can add the creation of tar and gzip in the
build.xml file. If you are the first to post a working version of the
build.xml addition for tar and zip, then you will get 2 bonus points
for this assignment.

</li><li> Do NOT send your assignment as an email attachment to be considered as submission.

</li><li> Upload your assignment to Blackboard, assignment-1.


</li></ul>


<h3> General Requirements </h3> 
<ul>

<li> Start early and avoid panic during the last couple of days.

</li><li> Submit a README.txt file (placed at the top level). The
README.txt file should be filled out as described in that file.

</li><li> You need to provide exception handling in your code. 

</li><li> Separate out code appropriately into methods, one for each purpose. 

</li><li> You should document your code. The comments should not exceed 72
coloums in width. Use javadoc style comments if you are coding in Java.

</li><li>  Do not use "import XYZ.*" in your code. Instead, import each required type individually.

</li><li> EVERY line of code that you submit in this assignment should be
written by you, or be part of the code template provided for
this assignment, or be from a website/book that you have cited in the
README. Do NOT show your code to any other group. Our code-comparison
software can very easily detect similarities.

</li><li> All objects, in Java, that may be needed for debugging purposes
should have the "toString()" method defined.

</li></ul>

<h3> Late Submissions </h3>

<ul>

<li> The policy for late submissions is that you will lose 10% of the
grade for each day that your submission is delayed.

</li></ul>


<h3> Grading Guidelines </h3>
